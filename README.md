Temperature Converter Shiny App
Description

This is a simple Shiny app that allows users to convert temperatures between Celsius and Fahrenheit. The app takes user input for a temperature value and a conversion option, and then displays the converted temperature.
Requirements

Before running the app, make sure you have the following installed:

    R: The statistical computing environment. You can download it from https://cran.r-project.org/.

    Shiny package: You can install the Shiny package from R by running the following command in the R console:

    install.packages("shiny")

Installation
Step 1: Install R

If you don't have R installed, download and install it from CRAN.
Step 2: Install the Shiny package

Once R is installed, open RStudio or your preferred R environment and run the following command to install the Shiny package:

install.packages("shiny")

Step 3: Download or Clone the Project

    Download the project files directly from GitHub as a .zip file or clone it if you're using Git.
    To clone the repository, use the following command:

    git clone https://github.com/your-username/temperature-converter.git

    Replace your-username with your actual GitHub username.

Running the App
Step 1: Open the Project in RStudio

    Open the folder containing the project files in RStudio.

Step 2: Run the App

    Open the app.R file in RStudio (or the file containing the Shiny app code).

    Click the Run App button in the top-right corner of RStudio, or run the following command in the R console:

    shiny::runApp("path/to/your/app.R")

    Replace "path/to/your/app.R" with the actual path to your Shiny app file.

Step 3: Interact with the App

    The app will open in your default web browser.

    Enter a temperature value in the input field and select the conversion type (Celsius to Fahrenheit or Fahrenheit to Celsius).

    The converted temperature will be displayed below the input fields.

How It Works

    The app has a numeric input for entering the temperature to be converted.

    A dropdown menu lets users choose the conversion type (either Celsius to Fahrenheit or Fahrenheit to Celsius).

    The app uses reactive expressions to automatically recalculate the temperature conversion based on the userâ€™s input.

    The converted temperature is displayed in the main panel as text output.
